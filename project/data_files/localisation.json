    "AA": "A plain of grass stretches out around you. Flowers sway gently in the breeze. You detect no sign of civilisation.",
    "AB": "The grass comes up to your knees. A long trail of trampled vegetation stretches behind you.",
    "AC": "Gentle hills rise and fall here. Standing at the crest of one, you survey your surroundings. More grass. More hills. Nothing else.",
    "AD": "In a field of grass, you find a lone pond. The water is clear; you can see all the way to the bottom. Nothing stirs beneath the surface.",
    "AE": "A few trees are scattered around the field, swaying in the wind.",
    "AF": "A small wooden hut stand ahead of you. Nothing but grass stretches for miles around it.",
    "BA": "You suddenly find yourself on the edge of a small clearing. A few small houses stand within it. The hamlet is silent and still.",
    "BB": "A strip of rocks splits the forest in two. In the middle of the divide, the rocks plunge a foot, into a thin creek.",
    "BC": "You pause before a tree with strange markings on. Carved by a knife, they are old and faded.",
    "BD": "The canopy above you is thick. Scattered rays of light shine down on the dark underbrush.",
    "BE": "The ground beneath you is hard. You glance down, and see the shape of cobblestones.",
    "BF": "Your path runs through a small ravine. It is shallow, but the steep walls only allow you a few feet of space.",
    "CA": "A few round huts sit on poles driven into the bogland. Smoke rises from their chimneys.",
    "CB": "You struggle to find a solid path through the swampland. Every few steps, the wet ground gives swallows your feet.",
    "CD": "Ahead of you, just beyond a pond, a raven sits perched in a tree. It's huge; the tree branch bends beneath its weight. It watches you silently.",
    "CE": "You walk alongside a large stretch of water, its surface covered with peat. Something just barely pokes out of the water. It looks metallic",
    "DA": "The wind howls. You shiver.",
    "DB": "You pause in a small crevice, sheltering from the wind. Some sort of shrine is carved into the rockface. Beads decorate a cross-legged figure.",
    "DC": "The path here is unstable. Each footstep sends pebbles cascading down the below.",
    "DD": "In the far distance, you spy a silhouette. It paces back and forth across the path.",
    "DE": "Smoke rises past the mountain peak. It source must be close.",
    "EA": "The ground is dusted with snow, broken by patches of moss or rocks. Here and there, footprints are stamped in the snow, stretching out ahead of you.",
    "EB": "The tundra is totally barren, as if some cosmic force couldn't be bothered to put anything here.",
    "FA": "In a moment, the clear sky becomes overcast. Heavy rain begins to beat down on you. Water courses down from the sides of the valley. The ground is quickly flooding.",
    "FB": "As you round a bend in the valley, you spot something a figure floating down a stream. It's face down.",
    "FC": "The valley slopes upwards here. Somehow, the river follows it up.",
    "FD": "The sides of the valley are steep here, almost like a cliff face. Dozens of rectangular holes are carved into it. They look like doorways.",
    "ZA": "A plateau stretches as far as you can see. Ruined architecture dots the landscape. This is it. This is what you've been searching for.",
    "ZB": "You stumble through a thick fog. What you can see of the landscape is featureless. The air seems to brush against your skin like fabric. A deep hum emanates from all around you. You don't remember coming here. You don't know what 'here' is.",
    "ZC": "Ahead of you, the valley sinks into a great hole in the ground."

    "AB_0_description": "A few paces from you something rustles through the grass...",
    "AB_1_description": "You move slowly, the barely shifting the grass as you move. As you get close enough to see, the rustling stops. A brass necklace lies on the ground before you.",
    "AB_2_description": "You move slowly, trying not to shift the grass. Too slowly, in fact. By the time you reach patch that was rustling, its source has moved on.",
    "AB_3_description": "You lunge with all your force, easily clearing the distance. Your hands find something cold and smooth. A brass necklace.",

    "ZA_4_description": "The crow turns its head side ways, examining you with one eye. Suddenly, it leaps into the air, and seizes you in its talons. It lifts you through the hole in the cathedral, into the sky. The ground beneath you recedes, and the crow flies on.",
    "ZA_5_description": "The crow turns its head side ways, examining you with one eye. Suddenly, it lets out a piercing screech. You fall to your knees, clutching your ears.",
